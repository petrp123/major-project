Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30

Flappy Bird Style Game


Description:
	For my final project im going design a game similar to flappy bird. It is a game where you have a character that is constantly moving
	right and must jump through lines that change constantly.

TimeLine:
	we currently have 6-7 weeks to complete our final projects. I will spend the next two weeks figuring out the basic coding like jumping
	and collision. After that is done I will figure out how the screen is constantly moving right and how the pillars are randomly generated.
	After that I will spend the rest of the time making it look nice and creating states for different things I could include.
	
Must Haves:
	1. A character that drifts right constantly and can jump
	2. A basic map set up with pillars
	3. A Reset function that detects if you touch the pillars
	4. The map must constantly move right.

Nice to Haves:
	1. A special character for the "flappy bird"
	2. States like a start screen, end screen, game screen.
	3. A score and highscore counter.
	4. Special add ons as you get further.
	5. Speed increases depending on how far you are.
